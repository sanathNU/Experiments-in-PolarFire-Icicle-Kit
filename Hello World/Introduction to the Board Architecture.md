So, as you must have checked out, the Icicle Kit is a pretty awesome board.<br>
The first order of business is running the out of the box device boot, which loads YoctoLinux, which is a RISC-V based linux distribution, which comes pre-loaded into the eMMC( the flash disk part) of the SoC. The first boot ran without a hiccup as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/icicle-kit-user-guide/icicle-kit-user-guide.md) guide!<br>
This is apart from the liscening part of the FPGA which should be done seperately. <br>
The internal architecture of the board is very complex and should be studied from the Documents are uploaded in this repository.
