# Experiments-in-PolarFire-Icicle-Kit
This repository contains all details and experiments conducted on the [PolarFire Soc Icicle Kit](https://www.microsemi.com/existing-parts/parts/152514) board. <br> <br>

It is a very powerful device which has a lot of capabilities. Here, we have documented working from the basics and adding more smaller projects and tutorials. All links will be mentioned here. <br>
The features of the board can be found in the [Quick Start Guide](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/polarfire-soc-icicle-quick-start-guide). <br>
The documentation for PolarFire SoCs are present in [this](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation) github repository. A quick handy repository similar to the Microsemi page is [MPFS Icicle Kit User Guide](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/icicle-kit-user-guide/icicle-kit-user-guide.md) .It contains everything from theory to some examples to download and run on the board.
All the results will be documented here.<br>
Let's have some fun! :metal: <br>

1. 'Hello World' folder covers the basic design of the FPGA and the running the 'out-of-the-box-linux-boot' of it. <br>
2. 'Basic Gates' contains our running a small design for testing out simple combinational circuits on the Libero SoC Software.
3. 'Combinational Circuit' contains a simple design and code for running a JK Flip Flop on the Board.

Things to be added:
1. Introduction to the Board and Reference Design and what we plan to do with it.
2. Booting up normally and the terminal according to all guides.
3. Running the Basic Gates code
4. Running the JK Flip Flop code for clocked circuits.
5. Final implemntation of Convolution code?
