In this tutorial we followed, we were able to complete to program simple gates. We followed the tutorial from [this](https://microchipdeveloper.com/fpgadt:libero-getting-started) tutorial webpage. Though this is not meant for the PolarFire Icicle Kit, this can e used for general Libero Usage. As mentioned in the guide, this part is divided into 6 "Lessons", starting from creating a design to programming it on the FPGA kit.
### Lesson 1 - Creating the PolarFire Project
Here, we create a simple Project called "BasicGatesProject", whose folder will be uploaded here. Anyone who is interested to replicate the results, just download the folder and open the ".prjx" file, which should automatically open the project in Libero Soc.
### Lesson 2 - Creating the Design
### Lesson 3 - Synthesis and Pin Assignment
### Lesson 4 - Programming the Design
### Lesson 5 - Running the Design
### Lesson 6 - Design Iterations in Libero SoC PolarFire
